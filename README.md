# IRIS on FHIR

IRIS on FHIR it's a SMART app to show the potencial of FHIRaaS using SMART JS Client Library

## Description

IRIS on FHIR it's our idea of how easy and simple we can work with FHIR, crafting a great UI to show the power behind FHIRaaS.

We hope that our project makes it easier for everyone to understand; we want to share knowledge and show that something good is not necessarily complicated.

We hope that our project can be used as a base/example for many others, unlocking more and more features.

## How IRIS on FHIR looks like

### Patient List

The page is a list of patients using the Resource Patient.

The data table recognizes the array provided for the Patient resource and shows a little information about the patient.

### Patient View

When clicking on the Patient's Given Name link, you'll be redirected to the Patient View page. A page with more information about that patient.

On the top, we have the patient photo, patient FHIR ID, SSN, Date of Birth, gender, contact, address, city, Country.

The middle section provide two section cards:

* Last Encounter
* Last Observations:Laboratory

The component badge pills bring the total count for the respectives cards.

For the card of Observations:Laboratory the badge pill open a new page bringing the lab results.
