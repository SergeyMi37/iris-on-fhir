# IRIS on FHIR

IRIS on FHIR it's a SMART app to show the potencial of FHIRaaS using SMART JS Client Library

## Description

IRIS on FHIR it's our idea of how easy and simple we can work with FHIR, crafting a great UI to show the power behind FHIRaaS.

We hope that our project makes it easier for everyone to understand; we want to share knowledge and show that something good is not necessarily complicated.

We hope that our project can be used as a base/example for many others, unlocking more and more features.
